# How to contribute

We are really excited you have taken an interest in our little project.  Our goal is to to eventually have so many contributors it becomes difficult to tell who exactly started or "owns" the project.

The best way to contribute, as with many other similarly new projects, is to just take a look around and identify one of many areas that could use improving.  Don't bother asking for permission, just fork it and go!

## Areas to contribute

With such a young project we've got opportunities everywhere.  The best place to start is the [Issues](/../../issues) List

##Non-Wonderware Contributions
If you want to help but you don't use Wonderware software it's not a problem.  If you take a look at our Testing project you can see we've included a number of reference log files that you can use for testing and development purposes.  Obviously it would be a little tricky since you can't use the built-in Log Viewer provided with the Wonderware applications but I think we've got most of the core log reader functions covered at this point.  Alternative areas you can help are improving test covereage, documentation, or possibly the Web API.

## Testing

We have a testing project that utilizes the NUnit framework.  Big opportunities to improve test coverage.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](/../../pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request we will love you forever if you include test coverage. Please follow our loose coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

Thanks,

Andy Robinson, Phase 2 Automation
